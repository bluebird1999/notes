* ARM Series
	* Cortex A1:
	
* ARM MMU
	* 32 bit ARM core has a 32 bit address space, namely 2^32=4GB, this is called "virtual address".
	* The physical address is decided by the real memory limit, a 256M memory has the physical address scope: 0x0000000 ~ 0x0FFFFFFF;
	* MMU is a chip reside on the core, take resiponsible of translation between virtual address and physical address.
	* In this example a 16bit core (64k virtual space) with a 32k ram space, MMU operates like:
	
		Virtual Address					Physical Address
		
			Page size=4k					Frame size=4k			(Page size must equal to Frame size)
		60~64k | Page 15 |						
				...
		28~32k | Page 07 |				| Frame 07 | 28~32k
		...								...
		00~04k | Page 00 |				| Frame 00 | 00~04k
		
		The virtual address for the 16bit (64k virtual space) is:
		
		4bits=16				12bits = 4096
		|a a a a|      |o o o o o o o o o o o o|
		page index			page offset
